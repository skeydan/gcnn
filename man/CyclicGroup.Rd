\title{A cyclic group of order `n`.}
\usage{
CyclicGroup(order)
}
\arguments{
\item{order}{the order of the group}
}
\description{
define a group

obtain a tensor containing all group elements in this group

define the group product on two elements

obtain inverse for a group element

group action of an element from the subgroup H on a vector in R2.
  For efficiency we implement this batchwise.

group action of elements of H on other elements in H itself. Comes down to group product.
  For efficiency we implement this batchwise. Each element in `h_batch` is applied to each element
  in `h_prime_batch`.

obtain a matrix representation in R2 for an element `h`

map the group elements to an interval `[-1, 1]`. We use this to create
  a standardized input for obtaining weights over the group.
